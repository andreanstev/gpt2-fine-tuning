Sinhas remarks are part of a detailed case study on the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) done by Professor Suraj Srinivasan of the Harvard Business School.   The study titled Securities Exchange Board of India: Developing and Regulating India?s Capital Markets has been done by Suraj along with research associate Radhika Kak.  According to the study, Sinha was reflecting on his past five years as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) when he made these remarks.     \"It was February 2016 and he had just been appointed by the Government of India to a second term as the Chairman of SEBI,\" it noted. While SEBI as a regulator has made significant strides over the past decade, it was during Sinhas tenure that its powers increased manifold including for bringing to book entities guilty of insider trading and fraudulent investment activities such as illicit collective investment schemes.

Charlotte Kemp . As any woman with a generous bosom will tell you, there are certain items of clothing you don\u2019t even bother trying on. For large busted women like Katie Price, a bra can make or break an outfit . Strapless dresses are definitely in the no-go camp. On the hanger they might promise summer glamour, but on anyone over a D-cup they\u2019d almost certainly end up making the bust look saggy and wobbly, instead of pert and firm. The key issue is getting the right support. And this is where better-endowed women have been let down \u2014 because, until recently, strapless bras just haven\u2019t been up to the task. Certainly, as a girl with an E-cup, the few times I\u2019ve braved a strapless bra it\u2019s been an unmitigated disaster. By far the worst embarrassment was at a ball as a top-heavy teen. The pesky thing offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless prom dress as I bopped away. When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to sidle off to the loos, whip it off and  abandon it. When you are wearing something so big it resembles Biggles\u2019 flying helmet, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to fit in your tiny evening bag. My only experience as a bridesmaid was just as torturous. The beautiful mauve dress had a bustier top and this time I chose a strapless contraption that was so tight, my d\u00e9colletage was flattened completely. I walked down the aisle cursing my unsightly mono boob. Ever since, I\u2019ve avoided dresses that require secret scaffolding. The pesky thing . offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless . prom dress. When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to abandon it . But finally there might be hope for women like me. This summer, several new strapless bras have been launched in bigger cup sizes to rescue us busty ladies. Charlotte Elliston, buyer for upmarket lingerie retailer Rigby & Peller, says fit is vital. \u2018The many common mistakes women make when purchasing a bra are all the more obvious when wearing a strapless garment,\u2019 she says. \u2018Most incorrectly-fitted women rely on the bra straps for support, but the majority of support in a bra should come from the back band, which should be a firm fit to the body.\u2019 Charlotte explains this may mean going down a back size to ensure a snugger fit. The underwire, meanwhile, should sit just beneath the bust rather than on the rib cage, without pressing on any breast tissue. The right size cup will encase the breasts at the side and sit flatly against the chest at the front. With her advice in mind I put the best of the High Street strapless bras to the test, rating each one for fit and staying power \u2014 and how well they performed when it came to the all-important issue of sagging. Scroll down for video . Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless Lace Up to a  G-Cup Bra \u00a336, Wonderbra.co.uk . This new Wonderbra has hand-shaped padding at the side to lift and support. It sits quite low on the chest, but pushes the boobs up well for just the right amount of cleavage. Firm hold thanks to the underwiring, moulded cups and silicone strips on the back band. To start with my breasts escaped from the cups, but once I\u2019d got the positioning right, it gave great lift and shape. Fit: 4.5/5 . Staying power: 5/5 . Sag factor: LOW .

Fit: 3.5/5 . Staying power: 3/5 . Sag factor: MEDIUM . Black Ultimate Longline Body Solutions Strapless  A-E Bra \u00a322.50, marksandspencer.com . The longer line gives this bra a glamorous look without creating too much wobbly cleavage. It has four hooks at the back, so I needed help to get into it, but it felt secure, held well and is available up to an E cup in three colours \u2013 black, white and a sugary pink. My only gripe was that the underwire comes up slightly too high at the side so it pressed a little on my breast tissue there. Great shape though. Some va va voom and lift without looking tarty.

When I put on the dress, the top . of my breasts got squashed giving me that dreaded \u2018double boob\u2019 look. The clear strap, meanwhile, looked like Sellotape. The bra generally . felt too loose and started to slip down after a while. It only goes up . to a DD \u2014 clearly not big enough to contain us busty girls. Fit: 3/5 . Staying power: 3/5 .

There was so . much lift, I couldn\u2019t see my shoes. The moulded design has optional gel . pads that slip into the cup to boost your bust even further, but on me . this caused side overspill. The downside is it only goes up to a DD. This just about fitted me but there are other strapless styles catering . up to a G cup. Would be great under a halterneck low-back dress if you . want to show off your biggest assets but while it did lift and separate . excellently and gave a firm hold, the barmaid look is not for me.

IBM is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. Traditional computers - whether they are household PCs or PlayStation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.\n\nThis gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. Whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is Sony's which is the most advanced. The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance.\n\nUsing a technology called XDR, created by American firm Rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by Intel. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent \"war on living rooms\". The big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as DVD players and hi-fis. Companies like Microsoft and Sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the TV of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place.\n\nMicrosoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its Windows Media Center software, which has been adopted by many PC makers. Sony had a stab at something similar with the PSX - a variation on the PlayStation - last year in Japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. Both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as PCs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack.\n\nSony and IBM want to make sure that the dominance of the PC market enjoyed by Microsoft and Intel is not allowed to extend to this market. By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. Once they have established themselves under the TV, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional PCs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems.\n\nSony hopes to put Cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. Resources of the Cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your TV, for example. This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. Because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight. Microsoft is going to be pushing its Xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not Sony's, will be under your tree next Christmas. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance.

'Every time I had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but I had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when I won the tie-break.' Verdasco was favourite to win that tie-break when an ace took him 5-3 ahead with another serve to come, but a terrible double fault let Djokovic off the hook and the Serbian eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10-8. Djokovic claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat-trick of aces.

But by early Wednesday, the remaining guests at the luxury hotel in the Libyan capital were reduced to raiding cabinets for cheese and fruit. About 35 journalists who were allowed into the North African country to cover the conflict with the blessing of the Moammar Gadhafi regime are trapped at the hotel for a fifth day. And about five more journalists covering clashes in the area fled into the hotel Wednesday morning and were briefly barred from leaving, said CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, who is among those at the hotel. Four were later allowed to go, she saw. But armed Gadhafi loyalists ring the hotel's perimeter and patrol its corridors, barring most journalists there from leaving. It's for their protection, the guards say. CNN's Matthew Chance, who is also at the hotel, urged other journalists in the city not to come for fear they, too, would be trapped. \"We are not being allowed to leave. We want to leave. We are obviously in a very fragile position,\" he said. They have enough snack food and bottled water to last for several days, he explained. \"After that, we're going to be in trouble,\" he added. So, as battle rages outside for control of Tripoli between pro-regime and rebel forces, the reporters can do little but sit and wait. With no air-conditioning and sporadic electricity, they walk the halls with the glow of candlelight to guide them. Giant paintings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stare down at them from hotel walls. Snipers keep a wary eye from rooftops. \"The concern we have now is that we seem to be in one of the few remaining patches of territory in Libya which is still controlled by Gadhafi's forces,\" Chance said. \"And so we're kind of very anxious about what might happen at this hotel in the hours ahead.\" The reporters spend their days in helmets and bullet proof vests. At night, they sleep on bedsheets in the hallway to avoid shards of glass from windows shattered by gunfire. \"This is not a comfortable position, but ... all in good spirits,\" BBC correspondent Matthew Price tweeted Tuesday. Chance said the journalists would like to \"negotiate an exit,\" but have been prevented from doing so. The reporters have put up white bed sheets from the top floor balconies of the hotel. In large black letters, they scrawled the words \"TV, press, don't shoot\" on them to leave no doubt they are impartial observers in the conflict. \"Gadhafi loyalists have basically regarded the international media as being on the rebels' side in this conflict, even though that's obviously not the case,\" Chance said. \"We're just here trying to report the government's side of things in this conflict.\" The hotel has served as a de facto media hub approved by the regime for international journalists and scores of government officials who relocated their families there during the civil war.

In May, Gadhafi himself made an unannounced appearance to hold a meeting with tribal leaders. His sudden appearance, and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely, has led to some speculation that Gadhafi himself is there, or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker. But Chance said he and other journalists had \"scoured\" the hotel \"from top to bottom\" and had seen no evidence of tunnels. On Tuesday, Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, turned up to debunk reports that rebels had captured him.

Celebratory gunfire rang out as residents took off with souvenirs, including reams of documents and weapons. But away from the action, the journalists waited as dawn gave way to another day Wednesday -- and more clashes erupted outside the hotel. Chance said their goal is to avoid agitating the guards. \"We do not want to prompt any dangerous action,\" he said. \"We are trying to stay as safe as possible.\" He hopes the nightmare, as he called it, ends soon. \"In a fizzle,\" he said. \"Not a bang.\"\"\nwhat conclusion can be drawn from the sentence summary above?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NEW: CNN's Matthew Chance at the hotel warns other journalists not to come .\nAbout 35 journalists, including from CNN, are trapped there .\nThey prowl the hall ways with giant paintings of Moammar Gadhafi staring down at them .\nThey sleep in hallways to avoid whizzing bullets ."}]}

The romantic fan popped the question after the second set of Djokovic's third-round match with Fernando Verdasco and received not only a 'yes', but a massive cheer from the rest of the crowd on Rod Laver Arena and applause from Djokovic himself. By that stage Djokovic had weathered the storm and was two sets ahead, the world number one crucially winning a tie-break in the opening set after failing to convert any of his six break points. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the Australian Open for the ninth consecutive year . Djokovic made the fourth round of the Australian Open with a 7-6 (8), 6-3, 6-4 win over Fernando Verdasco . Djokovic blows a kiss to the camera for his mother's birthday after winning his third round match . Djokovic of Serbia saw off  Verdasco of Spain at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday . 'Credit to Fernando, it was a great match,' Djokovic said in an on-court interview with four-time grand slim winner Jim Courier. 'Fernando is a top-10 player, he has played in the final stages of grand slams and big tournaments. He has big power in his game. 'Every time I had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but I had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when I won the tie-break.' Verdasco was favourite to win that tie-break when an ace took him 5-3 ahead with another serve to come, but a terrible double fault let Djokovic off the hook and the Serbian eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10-8. Djokovic claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat-trick of aces. From then on there was only ever going to be one winner and Djokovic celebrated his 7-6 (10/8) 6-3 6-4 win by getting the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to his mother Dijana. Next up for the four-time champion is Luxembourg's Gilles Muller, who won a big-serving battle with American John Isner that unsurprisingly featured tie-breaks in the first two sets and a total of 54 aces. Four-time champion Djokovic beat Verdasco (pictured), who could not get to the fourth round . Djokovic hugs  Verdasco after beating the Spaniard at the Australian Open in the third round . Defending champion Stan Wawrinka had earlier continued his far more unobtrusive progress in the championship, beating Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-4 6-2 6-4 to maintain his record of not having dropped a set. The fourth seed sent down nine aces and won 90 per cent of points behind his first serve to set up a clash with Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the fourth round. Garcia-Lopez was a similarly comfortable winner over Canada's Vasek Pospisil, beating the world number 60 6-2 6-4 6-4 to reach the last 16 and equal his best performance in a grand slam. 'I'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament,' Wawrinka said. 'For sure I'm not the focus on the tournament because there's Novak, Rafa (Nadal) coming back from injury, Roger (Federer) also just lost, there's (Nick) Kyrgios, (Bernard) Tomic still playing. 'For sure I'm not the focus. For me doesn't matter. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling great. I'm happy the way I'm playing. To get to the second week again, it's great. So far everything is good for me.' Feliciano Lopez continued his charmed progress through the draw with victory over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, the 12th seed winning 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 7-6 (7/3) to set up a last-16 contest with eighth seed Milos Raonic. The No 1-ranked Djokovic was able to see off the Spaniard and get to the fourth round for his ninth year . Djokovic supporters cheer his win after his third round match against Verdasco of Spain  in Melbourne . Lopez saved three match points in his first-round match with wild card Denis Kudla, eventually winning the fifth set 10-8, and saved another in the second round against Adrian Mannarino. Lopez was trailing 4-6 4-6 0-4 when Mannarino fell ill but won the third-set tie-break and was leading 4-0 in the fourth set when his unfortunate opponent retired. Lopez acknowledged he was making the most of his good fortune, adding: 'It gives you the chance. It gives you the opportunity to play today because I was already out with Mannarino and Kudla in the first round, no? 'Today when I was out there playing, I thought I have to be pleased for that opportunity, so try your best. I think today finally I play some of my best tennis. Losing with Kudla or Mannarino I wouldn't have the chance, so I feel very pleased. 'It's true I have a couple of tough matches. Today was also a tough one, but it was straight sets, which is really good for my fitness condition. I feel good. I feel ready to play the rest of the week.'

'Credit to Fernando, it was a great match,' Djokovic said in an on-court interview with four-time grand slim winner Jim Courier. 'Fernando is a top-10 player, he has played in the final stages of grand slams and big tournaments. He has big power in his game. 'Every time I had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but I had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when I won the tie-break.' Verdasco was favourite to win that tie-break when an ace took him 5-3 ahead with another serve to come, but a terrible double fault let Djokovic off the hook and the Serbian eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10-8. Djokovic claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat-trick of aces. From then on there was only ever going to be one winner and Djokovic celebrated his 7-6 (10/8) 6-3 6-4 win by getting the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to his mother Dijana.

IBM is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. Traditional computers - whether they are household PCs or PlayStation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.\n\nThis gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. Whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is Sony's which is the most advanced. The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance.\n\nUsing a technology called XDR, created by American firm Rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by Intel. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent \"war on living rooms\". The big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as DVD players and hi-fis. Companies like Microsoft and Sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the TV of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place.\n\nMicrosoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its Windows Media Center software, which has been adopted by many PC makers. Sony had a stab at something similar with the PSX - a variation on the PlayStation - last year in Japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. Both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as PCs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack.\n\nSony and IBM want to make sure that the dominance of the PC market enjoyed by Microsoft and Intel is not allowed to extend to this market. By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. Once they have established themselves under the TV, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional PCs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems.\n\nSony hopes to put Cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. Resources of the Cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your TV, for example. This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. Because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight. Microsoft is going to be pushing its Xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not Sony's, will be under your tree next Christmas. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance. If Cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future.

But by early Wednesday, the remaining guests at the luxury hotel in the Libyan capital were reduced to raiding cabinets for cheese and fruit. About 35 journalists who were allowed into the North African country to cover the conflict with the blessing of the Moammar Gadhafi regime are trapped at the hotel for a fifth day. And about five more journalists covering clashes in the area fled into the hotel Wednesday morning and were briefly barred from leaving, said CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, who is among those at the hotel. Four were later allowed to go, she saw. But armed Gadhafi loyalists ring the hotel's perimeter and patrol its corridors, barring most journalists there from leaving. It's for their protection, the guards say. CNN's Matthew Chance, who is also at the hotel, urged other journalists in the city not to come for fear they, too, would be trapped. \"We are not being allowed to leave. We want to leave. We are obviously in a very fragile position,\" he said. They have enough snack food and bottled water to last for several days, he explained. \"After that, we're going to be in trouble,\" he added. So, as battle rages outside for control of Tripoli between pro-regime and rebel forces, the reporters can do little but sit and wait. With no air-conditioning and sporadic electricity, they walk the halls with the glow of candlelight to guide them. Giant paintings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stare down at them from hotel walls. Snipers keep a wary eye from rooftops. \"The concern we have now is that we seem to be in one of the few remaining patches of territory in Libya which is still controlled by Gadhafi's forces,\" Chance said. \"And so we're kind of very anxious about what might happen at this hotel in the hours ahead.\" The reporters spend their days in helmets and bullet proof vests. At night, they sleep on bedsheets in the hallway to avoid shards of glass from windows shattered by gunfire. \"This is not a comfortable position, but ... all in good spirits,\" BBC correspondent Matthew Price tweeted Tuesday. Chance said the journalists would like to \"negotiate an exit,\" but have been prevented from doing so. The reporters have put up white bed sheets from the top floor balconies of the hotel. In large black letters, they scrawled the words \"TV, press, don't shoot\" on them to leave no doubt they are impartial observers in the conflict. \"Gadhafi loyalists have basically regarded the international media as being on the rebels' side in this conflict, even though that's obviously not the case,\" Chance said. \"We're just here trying to report the government's side of things in this conflict.\" The hotel has served as a de facto media hub approved by the regime for international journalists and scores of government officials who relocated their families there during the civil war. It also made headlines along the way. In March, Eman al-Obeidy, stormed the hotel in tears while journalists were having breakfast and said Gadhafi forces had raped her. In May, Gadhafi himself made an unannounced appearance to hold a meeting with tribal leaders. His sudden appearance, and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely, has led to some speculation that Gadhafi himself is there, or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker. But Chance said he and other journalists had \"scoured\" the hotel \"from top to bottom\" and had seen no evidence of tunnels. On Tuesday, Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, turned up to debunk reports that rebels had captured him. Hours after the son's defiance stance, rebel fighters and throngs of citizens stormed the ruler's fortress compound in Bab al-Aziziya not far away. Celebratory gunfire rang out as residents took off with souvenirs, including reams of documents and weapons. But away from the action, the journalists waited as dawn gave way to another day Wednesday -- and more clashes erupted outside the hotel. Chance said their goal is to avoid agitating the guards. \"We do not want to prompt any dangerous action,\" he said. \"We are trying to stay as safe as possible.\" He hopes the nightmare, as he called it, ends soon. \"In a fizzle,\" he said. \"Not a bang.\"\n\nSummary:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary of the text:\nNEW: CNN's Matthew Chance at the hotel warns other journalists not to come .\nAbout 35 journalists, including from CNN, are trapped there .\nThey prowl the hall ways with giant paintings of Moammar Gadhafi staring down at them .\nThey sleep in hallways to avoid whizzing bullets ."}]}

The study titled Securities Exchange Board of India: Developing and Regulating India?s Capital Markets has been done by Suraj along with research associate Radhika Kak.

While SEBI as a regulator has made significant strides over the past decade, it was during Sinhas tenure that its powers increased manifold including for bringing to book entities guilty of insider trading and fraudulent investment activities such as illicit collective investment schemes.

But by early Wednesday, the remaining guests at the luxury hotel in the Libyan capital were reduced to raiding cabinets for cheese and fruit. About 35 journalists who were allowed into the North African country to cover the conflict with the blessing of the Moammar Gadhafi regime are trapped at the hotel for a fifth day. And about five more journalists covering clashes in the area fled into the hotel Wednesday morning and were briefly barred from leaving, said CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, who is among those at the hotel. Four were later allowed to go, she saw. But armed Gadhafi loyalists ring the hotel's perimeter and patrol its corridors, barring most journalists there from leaving. It's for their protection, the guards say. CNN's Matthew Chance, who is also at the hotel, urged other journalists in the city not to come for fear they, too, would be trapped. \"We are not being allowed to leave. We want to leave. We are obviously in a very fragile position,\" he said. They have enough snack food and bottled water to last for several days, he explained. \"After that, we're going to be in trouble,\" he added. So, as battle rages outside for control of Tripoli between pro-regime and rebel forces, the reporters can do little but sit and wait. With no air-conditioning and sporadic electricity, they walk the halls with the glow of candlelight to guide them. Giant paintings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stare down at them from hotel walls. Snipers keep a wary eye from rooftops. \"The concern we have now is that we seem to be in one of the few remaining patches of territory in Libya which is still controlled by Gadhafi's forces,\" Chance said. \"And so we're kind of very anxious about what might happen at this hotel in the hours ahead.\" The reporters spend their days in helmets and bullet proof vests. At night, they sleep on bedsheets in the hallway to avoid shards of glass from windows shattered by gunfire. \"This is not a comfortable position, but ... all in good spirits,\" BBC correspondent Matthew Price tweeted Tuesday. Chance said the journalists would like to \"negotiate an exit,\" but have been prevented from doing so. The reporters have put up white bed sheets from the top floor balconies of the hotel. In large black letters, they scrawled the words \"TV, press, don't shoot\" on them to leave no doubt they are impartial observers in the conflict. \"Gadhafi loyalists have basically regarded the international media as being on the rebels' side in this conflict, even though that's obviously not the case,\" Chance said. \"We're just here trying to report the government's side of things in this conflict.\" The hotel has served as a de facto media hub approved by the regime for international journalists and scores of government officials who relocated their families there during the civil war. It also made headlines along the way. In March, Eman al-Obeidy, stormed the hotel in tears while journalists were having breakfast and said Gadhafi forces had raped her. In May, Gadhafi himself made an unannounced appearance to hold a meeting with tribal leaders. His sudden appearance, and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely, has led to some speculation that Gadhafi himself is there, or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker. But Chance said he and other journalists had \"scoured\" the hotel \"from top to bottom\" and had seen no evidence of tunnels. On Tuesday, Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, turned up to debunk reports that rebels had captured him. Hours after the son's defiance stance, rebel fighters and throngs of citizens stormed the ruler's fortress compound in Bab al-Aziziya not far away. Celebratory gunfire rang out as residents took off with souvenirs, including reams of documents and weapons.

The romantic fan popped the question after the second set of Djokovic's third-round match with Fernando Verdasco and received not only a 'yes', but a massive cheer from the rest of the crowd on Rod Laver Arena and applause from Djokovic himself. By that stage Djokovic had weathered the storm and was two sets ahead, the world number one crucially winning a tie-break in the opening set after failing to convert any of his six break points. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the Australian Open for the ninth consecutive year . Djokovic made the fourth round of the Australian Open with a 7-6 (8), 6-3, 6-4 win over Fernando Verdasco . Djokovic blows a kiss to the camera for his mother's birthday after winning his third round match . Djokovic of Serbia saw off  Verdasco of Spain at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday . 'Credit to Fernando, it was a great match,' Djokovic said in an on-court interview with four-time grand slim winner Jim Courier. 'Fernando is a top-10 player, he has played in the final stages of grand slams and big tournaments. He has big power in his game. 'Every time I had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but I had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when I won the tie-break.' Verdasco was favourite to win that tie-break when an ace took him 5-3 ahead with another serve to come, but a terrible double fault let Djokovic off the hook and the Serbian eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10-8. Djokovic claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat-trick of aces. From then on there was only ever going to be one winner and Djokovic celebrated his 7-6 (10/8) 6-3 6-4 win by getting the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to his mother Dijana. Next up for the four-time champion is Luxembourg's Gilles Muller, who won a big-serving battle with American John Isner that unsurprisingly featured tie-breaks in the first two sets and a total of 54 aces. Four-time champion Djokovic beat Verdasco (pictured), who could not get to the fourth round . Djokovic hugs  Verdasco after beating the Spaniard at the Australian Open in the third round . Defending champion Stan Wawrinka had earlier continued his far more unobtrusive progress in the championship, beating Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-4 6-2 6-4 to maintain his record of not having dropped a set. The fourth seed sent down nine aces and won 90 per cent of points behind his first serve to set up a clash with Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the fourth round. Garcia-Lopez was a similarly comfortable winner over Canada's Vasek Pospisil, beating the world number 60 6-2 6-4 6-4 to reach the last 16 and equal his best performance in a grand slam. 'I'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament,' Wawrinka said. 'For sure I'm not the focus on the tournament because there's Novak, Rafa (Nadal) coming back from injury, Roger (Federer) also just lost, there's (Nick) Kyrgios, (Bernard) Tomic still playing. 'For sure I'm not the focus. For me doesn't matter. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling great. I'm happy the way I'm playing. To get to the second week again, it's great. So far everything is good for me.' Feliciano Lopez continued his charmed progress through the draw with victory over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, the 12th seed winning 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 7-6 (7/3) to set up a last-16 contest with eighth seed Milos Raonic. The No 1-ranked Djokovic was able to see off the Spaniard and get to the fourth round for his ninth year . Djokovic supporters cheer his win after his third round match against Verdasco of Spain  in Melbourne . Lopez saved three match points in his first-round match with wild card Denis Kudla, eventually winning the fifth set 10-8, and saved another in the second round against Adrian Mannarino. Lopez was trailing 4-6 4-6 0-4 when Mannarino fell ill but won the third-set tie-break and was leading 4-0 in the fourth set when his unfortunate opponent retired. Lopez acknowledged he was making the most of his good fortune, adding: 'It gives you the chance. It gives you the opportunity to play today because I was already out with Mannarino and Kudla in the first round, no? 'Today when I was out there playing, I thought I have to be pleased for that opportunity, so try your best. I think today finally I play some of my best tennis. Losing with Kudla or Mannarino I wouldn't have the chance, so I feel very pleased. 'It's true I have a couple of tough matches. Today was also a tough one, but it was straight sets, which is really good for my fitness condition. I feel good. I feel ready to play the rest of the week.' Raonic continued the theme of one-sided matches by beating Germany's Benjamin Becker - who knocked out home favourite Lleyton Hewitt in the previous round - 6-4 6-3 6-3.
